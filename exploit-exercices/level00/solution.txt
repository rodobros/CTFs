1- when reading the man page of the "find" command, we see that argument "-user" allows us to find a file belonging to a specific user. Furthermore, we can specify a specific permission with the "-perm" argument.
2- execute the following command:
find / -user flag00 -perm -4000
3- since this gives us a bunch of "premission denied", add "2>/dev/null" to the command to remove stderr
4- this give us
/bin/.../flag00
/rofs/bin/.../flag00
5- executing either of those two gets us the flag
