1- Because it uses a legacy authentification scheme, notice that the /etc/passwd file contains the hash for the flag06 account. We can input the file to john_the_ripper to get the password!

2- executing john on the local machine doesn't work. We will have to run it on another machine. It is possible to get the file by using stfp.

3-Once we have the file on a machine with john_the_ripper (kali in my case), running the following command works:
john passwd

result:
Created directory: /root/.john
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (descrypt, traditional crypt(3) [DES 128/128 AVX-16])
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
hello            (flag06)
[...]

4- with the password "hello", we can now connect with ssh to the flag06 account and get the flag:
ssh flag06@localhost

5- executing getflag gets us the flag.
