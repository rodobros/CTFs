1- notice that the code calls system to execute the echo command with the flag and our input. here is what it looks like :
system("/bin/echo \"%s\"\n") where %s is our input in a flag-shape pattern.

2- we can have our input interepreted as a command with the following syntax: $(our command here)

3- first, after launching the program let's try
$(/bin/sh)

4- this make a prompt appear, after inputing "whoami" and "ls" nothing happens. However, our commands result appear after typing exit

5- We see that a file called flag.txt is in the directory. Let's do the same process as 3 to get the shell again

6- inputing cat flag.txt and then exit shows the flag
