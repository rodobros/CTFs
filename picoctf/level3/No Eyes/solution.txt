1.1 - inputing admin with a random password tells us "Incorrect Password."
1.2 - inputing admin with ' or 1=1 -- gives us "Flag is 63 characters"
1.3 - inputing a bad request after the quote tell us there is a problem with our request

2- we can put something  such as " 'or pass="a%""-- " to brute force the password character per character

3- write a script (see script.py in the same directory) that post HTTP request to do just that
4- the result of the script (it runs for about 5 minutes) is :
